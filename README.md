# SKYWATCH
SkyWatch is a Java-based console application that provides real-time weather information for any city in the world. The project follows all four principles of Object-Oriented Programming (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data using a free API key.
